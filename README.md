# hello-world
Hello world, tutorial/training repo.

I am a class-5 AutoIt scripter. I think it is a great programming language.
 (edit) I don't know where I dreamed up the "class-5" descriptor.
Specifically, I like the context-sensitive help.
I think cs-help is an essential attribute for all IDEs. It's a shame that the Arduino IDE does not have context-sensitive help.
 (edit) This file has been edited to test uploading of changes to GITHUB. First time via web browser.
 For some reason it doesn't have Windows line endings.
